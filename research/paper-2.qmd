Hukou, the household registration system in mainland China, has functioned as a barrier to migration for its residents.
Converting the hukou type is only possible under few instances. As a result, internal migration in China has met with great friction. It wasn't until 2014 that a reform relaxed migration restrictions among small to medium-sized cities. This period of strict migration control takes place in parallel with the rapid economic development in China. In this paper, I study the welfare impact of the hukou system, quantifying the productivity/welfare difference due to this strict migration restriction. I construct a quantitative spatial model, and use data after the reform to estimate the friction parameter. I then use it to construct the counterfactual scenario that tries to answer the question: how much welfare is lost?
